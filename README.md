Battle Frogs - Project 1 GA

##Battle Frogger

I will be making a copy of frogger, the 80â€™s game where players dodge objects to get to a destination point. It will be a two player game in which the MVP will be turn based and be scored on a timer. The ideal version of my game will have two players comeperting to get to the center of the screen.

##Objective of the game

In both versions the point of the game is to get to a set point faster than you opponent. Players will dodge obstacles of various size and speed. 

##Scoring
MVP: scoring will be determined by the quickest player (i.e. the lowest time recorded)

BC: Winner is determined by who gets to the center of the screen first

Game Board Layout

MVP: Players will start out at the bottom of the board, facing 4-6 rows of obstacles. The rows will vary in size and speed of said obstacles (i.e. lower levels will have smaller, slower loops, with the final level being a difficult but not impossible block of two fast moving objects. 

Best: Two players start off on either side of the screen, dodging 4-5 rows of obstacles. the player who gets to the center fastest wins.

Winner Declaration

MVP: the game will determine a winner by deciding which of the two times is the lowest.
